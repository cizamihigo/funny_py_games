### Matcher? What is this once again????
>>> Don't let your heart be troubled because of that name. matcher? are you concentrated?? can you remeber 
thing you just see right now???
 if yes you are a lucky guy, cause for the very time of this serie of codes, you are concerned.
 try to pick just one element from the grid buttons.
 **if they match?** that's it. you can try a second turn.
 **IF NOT** no way to loose remember the position of every element seen and try to open other hidden 
 elements if you find things like the one of which you've just memorized position, you are lucky if not 
 still memorizing positions.
